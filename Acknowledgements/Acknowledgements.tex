The research was carried out during my exchange study at University of California Santa Barbara and the research project was generously funded by the School of Science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am very grateful to HKUST and UCSB for providing me with this exchange opportunity, without which the research project would not be possible. 

I especially would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Carlos García-Cervera for giving me this research opportunity as well as his invaluable advice and guidance in helping me formulate this project. Not only did I obtain much insight into the topic, but I also had a good time talking and discussing problems with him as well as developed great interest in quantum mechanics. He was always available to answer many questions as well as give me constructive suggestions and ideas towards the success of this project. Throughout the whole project period, I truly appreciate the time he took to have regular meetings with me, during which he patiently listened to my presentations and corrected any mistakes that I made. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Prof. Carlos García-Cervera for his help, guidance, and support. 

I would also like to thank my friend, Wei Ren, who has been studying and discussing physics related to my research with me for the whole summer. I truly enjoyed working, talking and exploring new topics with Wei.
